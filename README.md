# Mac2MQTT (updated)

`mac2mqtt` is a program that allows viewing and controlling some aspects of computers running macOS via MQTT.

This repo is a fork of bessarabov/mac2mqtt, that add MQTT Autodiscovery and a KeepAwake function for the mac.

It publishes to MQTT:

 * current volume
 * volume mute state
 * battery charge percent
 * **media player information (title, artist, album, app name, state)**

You can send topics to:

 * change volume
 * mute/unmute
 * put the computer to sleep
 * shutdown computer
 * turn off the display
 * wake display
 * run macOS shortcuts

## Dependencies

## Installation

### Quick Installation (Recommended)

The easiest way to install Mac2MQTT is using the provided installer script:

```bash
./install.sh
```

The installer will guide you through the entire setup process, including:
- Building the application
- Configuring MQTT settings
- Installing optional dependencies
- Setting up the service to run automatically
- Creating management scripts

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to install manually, follow these steps:

### Running

To run this program you need to put 2 files in a directory (`/Users/USERNAME/mac2mqtt/`):

    mac2mqtt
    mac2mqtt.yaml

Edit `mac2mqtt.yaml` (the sample file is in this repository), make binary executable (`chmod +x mac2mqtt`) and run `./mac2mqtt`:

    $ ./mac2mqtt
    2021/04/12 10:37:28 Started
    2021/04/12 10:37:29 Connected to MQTT
    2021/04/12 10:37:29 Sending 'true' to topic: mac2mqtt/bessarabov-osx/status/alive

### Running in the background

You need `mac2mqtt.yaml` and `mac2mqtt` to be placed in the directory `/Users/USERNAME/mac2mqtt/`,
then you need edit the file `com.hagak.mac2mqtt.plist`
and replace `USERNAME` with your username. Then put the file in `/Library/LaunchAgents/`.

And run:

    launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/com.hagak.mac2mqtt.plist

(To stop you need to run `launchctl unload /Library/LaunchAgents/com.hagak.mac2mqtt.plist`)

## Home Assistant sample config

### Autodiscovery

The application supports Home Assistant MQTT autodiscovery. When connected to Home Assistant, it will automatically create:

- **Media Player** - Shows current playing media (requires Media Control)
- **Volume Control** - Number slider for system volume
- **Mute Switch** - Toggle for system mute
- **Battery Sensor** - Battery percentage (laptops only)
- **Keep Awake Switch** - Toggle to prevent system sleep
- **System Buttons** - Sleep, shutdown, display sleep/wake, screensaver
- **Display Brightness Controls** - Individual brightness sliders for each display (requires BetterDisplay CLI)

### Manual Configuration

If you prefer manual configuration, here's a sample:

`configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
script:
  air2_sleep:
    icon: mdi:laptop
    sequence:
      - service: mqtt.publish
        data:
          topic: "mac2mqtt/bessarabov-osx/command/sleep"
          payload: "sleep"

  air2_shutdown:
    icon: mdi:laptop
    sequence:
      - service: mqtt.publish
        data:
          topic: "mac2mqtt/bessarabov-osx/command/shutdown"
          payload: "shutdown"

  air2_displaysleep:
    icon: mdi:laptop
    sequence:
      - service: mqtt.publish
        data:
          topic: "mac2mqtt/bessarabov-osx/command/displaysleep"
          payload: "displaysleep"

mqtt:
  sensor:
    - name: air2_alive
      icon: mdi:laptop
      state_topic: "mac2mqtt/bessarabov-osx/status/alive"

    - name: "air2_battery"
      icon: mdi:battery-high
      unit_of_measurement: "%"
      state_topic: "mac2mqtt/bessarabov-osx/status/battery"

  media_player:
    - name: "air2_media_player"
      icon: mdi:music
      state_topic: "mac2mqtt/bessarabov-osx/status/media_player"
      value_template: "{{ value_json.state }}"
      json_attributes_topic: "mac2mqtt/bessarabov-osx/status/media_player"
      json_attributes_template: "{{ {'title': value_json.title, 'artist': value_json.artist, 'album': value_json.album, 'app_name': value_json.app_name, 'duration': value_json.duration, 'position': value_json.position} | tojson }}"
      availability_topic: "mac2mqtt/bessarabov-osx/status/alive"
      payload_available: "online"
      payload_not_available: "offline"
```

## MQTT topics structure

The program is working with several MQTT topics. All topics are prefixed with `mac2mqtt` + `COMPUTER_NAME`.
For example, the topic with the current volume on my machine is `mac2mqtt/bessarabov-osx/status/volume`

`mac2mqtt` send info to the topics `mac2mqtt/COMPUTER_NAME/status/#` and listen for commands in topics
`mac2mqtt/COMPUTER_NAME/command/#`.

### PREFIX + `/status/alive`

There can be `true` or `false` in this topic. If `mac2mqtt` is connected to MQTT server there is `true`.
If `mac2mqtt` is disconnected from MQTT there is `false`. This is the standard MQTT thing called Last Will and Testament.

### PREFIX + `/status/volume`

The value ranges from 0 (inclusive) to 100 (inclusive)â€”the current volume of the computer.

The value of this topic is updated every 60 seconds.

### PREFIX + `/status/mute`

There can be `true` or `false` in this topic. `true` means that the computer volume is muted (no sound),
`false` means that it is not muted.

### PREFIX + `/status/battery`

The value ranges from 0 (inclusive) to 100 (inclusive) and represents the current level of the battery. Returns empty if there is no battery.

The value of this topic is updated every 60 seconds.

### PREFIX + `/status/media_player`

Contains JSON with current media player information. Only available if Media Control is installed.

Example:
```json
{
  "state": "playing",
  "title": "Song Title",
  "artist": "Artist Name",
  "album": "Album Name",
  "app_name": "Spotify",
  "duration": 180,
  "position": 45,
  "media_title": "Song Title",
  "media_artist": "Artist Name",
  "media_album": "Album Name"
}
```

States: `playing`, `paused`, `idle`

### PREFIX + `/status/media_state`

The current state of media playback: `playing`, `paused`, or `idle`.

### PREFIX + `/status/media_title`

The title of the currently playing media.

### PREFIX + `/status/media_artist`

The artist of the currently playing media.

### PREFIX + `/status/media_album`

The album of the currently playing media.

### PREFIX + `/status/media_app`

The name of the application playing media (e.g., "Spotify", "Apple Music").

### PREFIX + `/status/media_duration`

The total duration of the media in seconds.

### PREFIX + `/status/media_position`

The current position in the media in seconds.

### PREFIX + `/command/volume`

You can send integer numbers from 0 (inclusive) to 100 (inclusive) to this topic. It will set the volume on the computer.

### PREFIX + `/command/mute`

You can send `true` or `false` to this topic. When you send `true` the computer is muted. When you send `false` the computer
is unmuted.

### PREFIX + `/command/runshortcut`

You can send the name of a shortcut to this topic. It will run this shortcut in the Shortcuts app.

### PREFIX + `/command/set`

You can send `screensaver` to this topic. It will turn start your screensaver. Sending some other value will do nothing.

You can send `displaywake` to this topic. It will turn on the display. Sending some other value will do nothing.

You can send  `sleep` to this topic, and it will put the computer to sleep. Sending other values will do nothing.

You can send `shutdown` to this topic. It will try to shut down the computer. The way it is done depends on the user who ran the program. If the program is run by `root` the computer will shut down, but if it is run by an ordinary user the computer will not shut down if there is another user who logged in. Sending some other value but `shutdown` will do nothing.

You can send `displaysleep` to this topic. It will turn off the display. Sending some other value will do nothing.


## Management Scripts
